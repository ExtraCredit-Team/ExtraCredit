Utilisation Rate U = Total Borrows / Total Liquidity

U optimal of DAI is 80%.

R(t) = R(0) + Rslope1*[U(t)/U(optimal)] for U(t) < 80%
R(t) = R(0) + Rslope1 + (Rslope2*[(U(t)-U(optimal))/(1-U(optimal))]) for U(t) > 80%

When U(t) > 80%, interest increases sharply
When U(t) < 80%, interest rate increases slowly

Reward split based on pool utilization, the depositor reward goes to a reward pool inside creditpool.
The harvesting for the depositor side is based on delegateAmount and duration.

Problems: when to compute and are we computing stable or variable?
